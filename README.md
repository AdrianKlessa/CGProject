# CGProject

The Computer Graphics project

How to run:
- clone the repo
- copy dependency folder from the 6th CG lab
- open with VS


To add (mandatory):
- moving fish
- air bubbles (could be added as particles?)


Current issues:
- It should be possible to add a simple underwater effect by rendering a semitransparent blue quad blocking the camera
- submarine still can go through objects
- limited view space
